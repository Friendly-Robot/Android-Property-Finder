# Android-Property-Finder
A react native application 

This was my first mobile application built with React Native.

It was part of a tutorial that found [here](https://www.raywenderlich.com/126063/react-native-tutorial).

The tutorial goes through the process of building an IOS application but I had chosen to build an Android version. 
Most of the implementation can be found in '..root/android/modules/' and '..root/index.android.js'
